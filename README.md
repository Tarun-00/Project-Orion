Project Orion is a project made by me to tackle the problem of Malicious Actors accessing systems to gain access of PII and SPII.

Project Orion runs on a small development board with an attached display that shows information about total system health and overall security strength of the system.

It uses no resources of any server an runs on the development board itself and can tackle various day to day security vulnurabilities.

It provides a detailed report about the system's health and possible fixes to impliment.

Compatible with amd, aarch, RISC and ARM architecture.

It comes with carious themes to show information on the attached display.
